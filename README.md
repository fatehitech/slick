Slick is a group chat application in which a directory represents a room.

The directory is expected to be synchronized between multiple users by an external process.

Examples of directory syncing/sharing mechanisms that should work include Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft Skydrive, and Bittorrent Sync.
